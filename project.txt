Project Title: Automated E-commerce Price Monitoring and Market Insights System
Objective: Build an automated system to scrape product data from e-commerce websites, analyze pricing trends, generate reports, and provide market insights to optimize pricing strategies.

Project Workflow
1. Web Scraping Product Information
Tools: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium (if required for dynamic websites), pandas
Steps:

Write Python scripts to scrape product data (e.g., product name, price, ratings, seller, discounts) from multiple e-commerce websites (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Walmart).

Handle pagination and anti-scraping mechanisms (e.g., delays, headers, rotating proxies).

Save raw data into structured formats like CSV or JSON.

Example Code Snippet:

python
Copy
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

def scrape_amazon_product(url):
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    products = []
    for item in soup.select('.s-result-item'):
        name = item.select_one('.a-text-normal').text.strip()
        price = item.select_one('.a-price-whole').text if item.select_one('.a-price-whole') else 'N/A'
        products.append({'Product': name, 'Price': price})
    
    return pd.DataFrame(products)

# Repeat for other websites and combine data
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation with Pandas
Tools: pandas, numpy
Tasks:

Clean scraped data:

Handle missing values (e.g., fill N/A prices with median values).

Standardize formats (e.g., currency conversion, date formatting).

Remove duplicates.

Enrich data by merging with existing datasets (e.g., historical prices, competitor data).

Example Code:

python
Copy
def clean_data(df):
    # Remove duplicates
    df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['Product'])
    # Clean price column (e.g., remove currency symbols)
    df['Price'] = df['Price'].str.replace('$', '').astype(float)
    # Fill missing prices with median
    df['Price'].fillna(df['Price'].median(), inplace=True)
    return df
3. Storing and Managing Data with SQL
Tools: SQLite/PostgreSQL, sqlalchemy
Tasks:

Create a database to store scraped data.

Use SQL queries to analyze trends (e.g., price fluctuations, competitor pricing).

Example Code:

python
Copy
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Save cleaned data to SQL database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///ecommerce_prices.db')
df.to_sql('product_prices', engine, if_exists='replace')

# Query to find top 10 most expensive products
query = '''
SELECT Product, Price 
FROM product_prices 
ORDER BY Price DESC 
LIMIT 10
'''
pd.read_sql(query, engine)
4. Generating Automated Weekly Reports
Tools: openpyxl, pandas
Tasks:

Create Excel reports with:

Summary metrics (average price, cheapest/most expensive products).

Visualizations (price distribution charts, competitor comparisons).

Automate report generation using Python scripts.

Example Code:

python
Copy
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.chart import BarChart, Reference

def generate_excel_report(df):
    wb = Workbook()
    ws = wb.active
    # Add data to Excel
    for row in dataframe_to_rows(df, index=False, header=True):
        ws.append(row)
    # Create a bar chart
    chart = BarChart()
    data = Reference(ws, min_col=2, max_col=2, min_row=1, max_row=10)
    chart.add_data(data)
    ws.add_chart(chart, "D1")
    wb.save("weekly_price_report.xlsx")
5. Deriving Market Insights
Tools: matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
Tasks:

Analyze data to identify:

Competitors’ pricing strategies.

Price trends over time (e.g., discounts during holidays).

Products with the highest price volatility.

Provide actionable recommendations (e.g., "Reduce price of Product X by 10% to match competitor Y").

Example Insights:

"Product A is priced 15% higher than the market average—consider a limited-time discount."

"Seller Z consistently undercuts competitors by 20%—monitor their inventory."

6. Automation and Deployment
Tools: cron (Linux), Task Scheduler (Windows), PythonAnywhere
Tasks:

Schedule scripts to run daily/weekly (e.g., scrape data every Monday).

Deploy the system to run autonomously.

Deliverables
A GitHub repository with:

Web scraping scripts.

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization.

SQL schema and sample queries.

Automated Excel report generation code.

A 1-page summary of market insights and business impact (e.g., "Automation saved 20 hours/week").

(Optional) A Streamlit/Power BI dashboard for real-time price monitoring.

Skills Demonstrated
Web scraping and data collection.

Data cleaning/transformation with pandas.

SQL for data management.

Automated reporting with openpyxl.

Market analysis and actionable insights.

Process automation (time savings).
